A Ceaser Cypher Encryptor/Decryptor CLI Tool

##Summary
This was a project that I did as extra credit for my finite mathematics class in my first undergraduate year of computer engineering.
It contains a few tools (sum which I admit are pointless) that can decypher or help analyze alphabetic text that has been ciphered using the classic vigenere and ceaser ciphers.

##Details and Features
- The entire program is written in pure C
- The program offers a few different tools that are called by the Ceaser Decipher tool but are made available if the user wishes to do any manual work
- The program has a history and save feature. Everytime you call the decipher tool, the result is appended to the end of the output file prefixed with a timestamp

##A Few Notes
- My code isn't that well documented (actually it isn't documented at all), as I was trying to finish the project on time, because I procrastinated doing it until I had a week left O:)
- Some aspects of the code are reduntant and could have been implemented better.
- Despite my lack of documentation, I tried my best to comment as much as I could, but if there's any part that you're having difficulty understanding, feel free to message me and I'll be glad to help.
- At the time I wrote the code I wasn't that well informed about coding in compliance with the C Standard, I was only aware of whatever the compiler warned me about, so it is possible that some aspects of my code are non standard compliant.
