But by going upstairs away from all this, Din Gadsby humming happily, found Sarah and Lucy Nancy and Kathlyn amidst a roomful of girls doing dainty fancy work, and what astonishing ability most of that group did show. Nancy bought a baby cap which was on a par with anything in Branton Hill's shops, and though Kathlyn said it was just too cunning for anything, John smith's bungalow didn't contain anybody just now whom it would fit but lady Gadsby. With a party of Branton Hill's matrons, was calling for Gadsby to hurry down a long corridor to a loom room, saying that such dainty rugs mats and scarfs of cotton and silk hung all around on walls or racks. It was truly astonishing that girls could do such first class work having had long hours of labor in Broadway's shops all day. Although most of our standard occupations found room for activity, an occasional oddity was run across so his Honor's party found two boys and two girls working at that always fascinating art of glass blowing, and what a dainty trick it is, and what an opportunity to burn a thumb or two if you don't wait for things to cool. Things of charming form and fragility grow as by a magicians wand from small glass tubings of various colors, Birds with glorious wings, ships of crystal sailing on dark billows, tiny buildings in a thick glass ball which upon agitation stirs up a snow storm which softly lands on pink rooftops. Many a fancy drinking glass and bowl oil lamps ashtrays and gaudy strings of tiny crystal balls for adorning party gowns and did Nancy want to buy out this shop? And did frank doubt his ability to do so? and did Kathlyn ask how about it Johnny? And did John Smith say nothing? Doing it was just that, but it only shows that good old Branton Hill's inclination for aiding anything which looks worthy, and such a school I know you will admit looks that way.
